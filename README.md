## Group #4: <br> <p align="center"> Orcs & Towers </p>

### About the Game

**Orcs & Towers** is a tower defense game where the player must defend their base from waves of orcs. The player can build towers to defend their base and expand the map to make the path longer for the orcs. The player can also upgrade their towers to make them more powerful.

### How to Play

With the project still in its development form, there is no executable file to run. The project can be run by opening the project in Unity, loading in the StartScene.unity or Scene.unity, and pressing the play button.

### Requirements

The requirements for this project are as follows:

* Unity 2021.3.14f1
* .NET Standard 2.1, C# 7.0

### Required Deliverables for the Project

Each increment of the project requires a set of deliverables to be completed. On the submission of a new increment, a new branch will be made to preserve the state of the project at that time. The deliverables are located in the **/Docs/ folder**. They can also be found by clicking the links below. If the documents appear to be of a previous increment, please check which branch you are on. These deliverables are as follows:

* [Software Implementation and Testing Document](/Docs/ITDoc.md)
* [Software Requirements and Design Document](/Docs/RDDoc.md)
* [Increment Progress Report](/Docs/ProgReport.md)

#### Videos

Each increment required a video to be submitted. While each increment video can be found separately in the Increment Progress Report file in its specific increment branch, for the sake of bringing them all to one place, here are all the videos in one place:
