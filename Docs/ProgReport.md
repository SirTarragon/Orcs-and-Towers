### 2) **Project Title and Description**

#### **Orcs & Towers**

Orcs & Towers is a tower defense game where the player must defend their base from waves of orcs. The player can build towers to defend their base and expand the map to make the path longer for the orcs. The player can also upgrade their towers to make them more powerful.

### 3) **Accomplishments and overall project status during this increment**

So far we have the base code to build on for our game written out, the map generation has been thoroughly built to fit our purposes with map expansion, we also have implemented a health bar that is fully functional. In terms of where we would like the game to be when completed, we still have quite a bit left to work on, some of the things we have left are: Play/Pause functionality, upgradable towers/different types of towers, different types of enemies, game over and main menu screens, sprites and animations for all of the features of the game (most everything is different colored squares as of now), and a few other things.

### 4) **Challenges, changes in the plan and scope of the project and things that went wrong during this increment**

One of the early-on challenging things was getting the different Scene environments each member of the group working. Early on, we had difficulties with playtesting and editing due to these conflicts. We were able to rectify it by having the person with a working copy of the Scene to save it and to make sure to push it through GitHub (this scene wasn’t being properly saved prior).

Another challenge that came up was making the code less complicated and more modular from the tutorial code. Things like the tower cost and name not being saved to the base tower class made adding in new towers difficult at first but was fixed in the end by adding in new variables and functions. Base code was also cleaned up to be more functional and/or readable. This contributed to things like more enemies and towers not being able to be added in the first increment. With the second increment there should be more diversity in towers and enemies.

### 5) **Team Member Contribution for this increment**

* Daniel Pijeira — Wrote game pause function and accompanying UI scripts. Described how functional requirements were tested and methods used. Described how the team used non-execution based testing and methods used in the IT document. Contributed and participated in the video presentation showcasing the first increment.
* Lawrence Martinez — Modified the Tower Class to have a more dynamic UI and have the UI auto update when cost and name changes and cleaned up some of the base code from the tutorial video. Added in the Sniper Tower type. Worked on functional and non-functional requirements. Added to challenges in the Progress Report. Added to assumptions and dependencies. Peer-reviewed design diagrams. Participated in recording the video and showing current progress.
* Nathan Granger — Helped write project title and description, helped write the accomplishments and overall project status, and helped write the plans for next increment on the Progress Report. Helped write the program languages, and Platforms API’s Databases and other technologies sections in the IT document. Helped write the overview, and operating environment sections in the RD document. Wrote up the base code needed for the game from watching free open source tutorial videos, modified the map generation code to fit our original purposes. Wrote the code for the HealthBar class. Participated in the Zoom meeting for the video.
* Tyler McLanahan — Contributed towards tower development and functionality which included development of elemental towers, projectiles, and the interaction between enemies and towers. This also included the implementation of the Frost Tower. Additionally contributed to quality of life graphics improvements and bug testing/fixing in map generation. Finally, assisted in writing functional and nonfunctional requirements in the RD document and helped guide the video demonstration for the first increment.
* Tyler Pease — Contributed to the project title and description, increment challenges, as well as the planning for the next increment in the progress report. Contributed to the programming language segment for the IT document. Developed the Use-Case, Class, and Sequence diagrams for the RD document. Mainly overhauled the map generation code to allow for more sophisticated maps and an isometric generation, and, in addition, work on a number of fixing issues in other segments of the project. Participated in recording the video and utilizing Unity to display current progress.
