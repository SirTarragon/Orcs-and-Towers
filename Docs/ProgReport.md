### 2) **Project Title and Description**

#### **Orcs & Towers**

Orcs & Towers is a 2D, fantasy, tower defense game where the player must defend their base from waves of orcs. The player can build and upgrade towers to defend their base and expand the map to make the path longer for the orcs. The player is given a set number of lives and a starting amount of money to purchase towers with, each round ends when all enemies have been destroyed.

### 3) **Accomplishments and overall project status during this increment**

During this increment we were able to fix most of the previous map expansion problems, along with many other small bugs, we were also able to implement a couple more of the features we mentioned that we wanted to get done in the previous progress report like the Pause/Play functionality, different tower types, different enemy types, a Game Over screen functionality, Start Game landing/home screen, and the addition of player points/score for enemy kills. We would really like to get more animation added in, and there are a few nagging issues that need to be fixed. While we were able to get a decent amount of functionality added this increment, our game still has a ways to go.

### 4) **Challenges, changes in the plan and scope of the project and things that went wrong during this increment**

There are a number of different changes to the original scope of the project, mainly due to the lack of major progress with these aspects. The core functionality of the project has been limited to an expanding map mechanic, with the addition of a story mode and a preset path gameplay being fully dropped as goals. We were also unable to add really any sort of animation in this increment.  It is hard to say the reasoning for these changes/issues, it seems team members ended up being busier than originally expected and were unable to fully implement their proposed functionalities. Hopefully by the end of Increment 3 some type of sandbox mode functionality can be implemented.

### 5) **Team Member Contribution for this increment**

* Daniel Pijeira — Added fast forward functionality where ingame time scale is doubled upon click and returned to normal upon second click using FastForward script. Added to functional requirements in RD Doc. Added to non-execution based testing. Participated in the video presentation.
* Lawrence Martinez — Added to functional requirments in the RD document and non-functional testing in the IT document. Added in the fire tower type and finished associated code along with added to some elemental tower code. Also added in an enemy that spawns more enemies upon death but at the moment can only spawn one enemy. Participated in the video presentation. Added to textual descriptions of use case diagrams.
* Nathan Granger — During this increment I was able to build and push up several game functions that were mentioned in the last increment as being needed. First I pushed up a Game Over screen with functionality to restart current game or to go back to the main menu screen, secondly I created and pushed up a Start Menu/Main menu screen for the game to us as a landing page when the game begins, thirdly I was able to look at how Daniel had set up his pause screen and created a pause button UI element for our game that when clicked calls the paused screen functions to pull up the screen and pause the game, lastly this increment I was able to get the player points/money system partly up and running making it so players can see their score/money while playing and so that when one of the players towers destroys an enemy a kill reward is added to their score. In the Progress Report I wrote the ‘Accomplishments and overall project status’ section, added to the 'Challenges, changes in the plan and scope' section, added to 'Plans for the next increment' section, and added to 'Project Title and Description' section. In the RD Doc I added to the ‘Assumptions and Dependencies’ section, and to the ‘Operating Environment’ section. I also participated in this increments video presentation.
* Tyler McLanahan — Added in functionality for a new player resource called Boons. This resource can temporarily boost tower stats within a predetermined range like damage, range, fire rate, and even gold production. It can be purchased from the shop for a cheaper rate than building towers. Cleaned up and improved parts of tower and enemy classes. Contributed to the development of the RD document by adding functional and non-functional requirements. 
* Tyler Pease — Detailed the change of scope in the progress report and planning for next increment. Updated diagrams for the RD document based on changes throughout the increment. Implemented Special Enemy type and ability casting system, status effect data, additional enums, implemented path splitability for the map, and rendering of sprites for map tiles. Added buttons to the Unity Editor inspector to manually trigger things in some of the classes for testing purposes. Conducted some bug fixing along the way. Participated in Video presentation.

### 6) **Plans for the next increment**

* Fixing of major bugs
* Finish developing of enemy types
* Finish developing of tower types
* Tower Upgrade system
